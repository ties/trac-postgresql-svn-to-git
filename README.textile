h1. Introduction

This is a fork of https://github.com/practicalweb/TRAC-SVN-to-GIT-migration which has been updated to work with PostgreSQL.

Where does this differ from the original:
* supports Trac 0.12 style commit message comments
* scripts no longer chained
* uses PostgreSQL

h2. Main caveats

Most git svn howto's add --no-metadata. When using this for the initial checkout for this script, there is no list of SVN revisions and it fails to extract the lookupTable of Git<->SVN commit id's

h2. Usage & Configuration

* edit convertTracTickets.php to match your database details
* extract the SVN<->Git revision map with extractRevList.sh
* convert the trac tickets (php convertTracTickets.php)

h1. Original notes

Use this script if you have an existing trac project which has built up a history with svn and you have switched to git.

This project will have tickets which reference svn revision numbers - but now the project needs git IDs instead.

extractRevList.sh - will extract a list of git IDs annd svn revision numbers from the history created by git-svn

convertTracTickets.php - This will update the trac database - so that the links to commits still work.

This code has worked for me - but I STRONGLY SUGGEST TAKING BACKUPS before starting.

THIS CODE IS POTENTIALLY DESTRUCTIVE

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
